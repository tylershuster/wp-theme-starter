# JS Utils

Utils **when imported or required** must not directly affect the page/site/app
in any way. Instead they are intended to be used/utilized as needed by the other
scripts in your application.

As such, utils must always export one or more methods that can optionally be
imported and invoked by the other scripts of the app.

## Why?

Utils are meant to be composable bits of code. Ideally you could make each util
into its own npm module. You should be able to use them in different parts of
your current site and you should even be able to take them with you when you
start your next project.

#### Example:

##### Bad Util:
```javascript
const els = $('[data-eq-heights]').toArray();

// when evaluated, the following code
// will immediately affect the DOM!
// This is fine for a "script", but not
// fine at all for a "util"
const naturalMaxHeight = els
  .forEach(el => $(el).css('min-height', 0))
  .reduce((max, {outerHeight}) => outerHeight > max ? outerHeight : max, 0);

els.forEach(el => $(el).css('min-height', naturalMaxHeight + 'px'));
```
##### Good Util
```javascript
// This is a util, it is re-usable and
// it can be invoked as needed by other
// scripts in your app. By itself it
// does nothing :)
export default function eqheights(selector) {
  const els = $(selector).toArray();

  const naturalMaxHeight = els
    .forEach(el => $(el).css('min-height', 0))
    .reduce((max, {outerHeight}) => outerHeight > max ? outerHeight : max, 0);

  els.forEach(el => $(el).css('min-height', naturalMaxHeight + 'px'));
}
```

the jQuery dependancy, on
